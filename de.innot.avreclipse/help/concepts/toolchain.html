<h1>AVR Eclipse Toolchain </h1>

<p>Whenever
    the project is build, a makefile is generated and executed, which implements
    the following process (for an AVR application): </p>
<p><img src="../images/toolchain.png" width="483" height="560"></p>
<ol>
    <li>The build process starts by executing the user supplied <strong>prebuild</strong> script/executable,
        where the user can define additional tasks that need to be run before the
        actual build process starts.<br>
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Then all source files are compiled</li>
    <li>and stored as Object files (*.o)<br>
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>The Linker takes all Object files and linkes them together in one file
        in ELF format.<br>
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>The ELF  file contains the binary code and data as well as
        debugging and other internal informations. Most AVR simulators can take
        a file in this format to run and debug the application.<br>
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Once the ELF file has been created, a user supplied <strong>Postbuild</strong> script/executable
        is called. See TODO on how to set the prebuild and postbuild options.<br>
        Calling the postbuild script at this point, before the secondary targets
        have been build, is a limitation of the CDT plugin.<br>
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>With the ELF file as input the Secondary Targets create some optional
        output files:
        <ul>
            <li>*.hex: A hex dump file for downloading to an AVR processor flash
                memory </li>
            <li>*.eep: A  hex dump file for downloading to an AVR processor EEPROM</li>
            <li>*.lss: An  extended listing with the source data intermixed with
                the generated assembler code</li>
            <li>Print size: prints the size of the generated application to the
                console.<br>
            Due to the internal design of CDT this &quot;outputs&quot; a pseudotarget called
            &quot;size_dummy&quot;, as without an output CDT would not include the avr-size
            command in the toolchain. </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    </ol>
