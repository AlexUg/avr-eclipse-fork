/**
 * Part Description File reader interface.
 * <p>
 * A PDFreader is used to parse Atmel part description files. The files are
 * handed to the implementation as a XML DOM Document. It is used by the
 * {@link PartDescriptionFilesReader} Class to delegate the parsing of the files
 * to specific modules.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The reader has a simple life cycle model with three states:
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link #start()}: This is called before the reading of files begin.
 * Implementations can set up their property stores in this method.</li>
 * <li>{@link #read(Document)}: This is called for every part description
 * file.</li>
 * <li>{@link #finish()}: This is called after all files have been read.
 * Implementations can persist the read properties here.</li>
 * </p>
