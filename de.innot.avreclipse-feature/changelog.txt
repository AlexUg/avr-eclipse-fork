Version 2.1.0

New:
=============================
* C++ Support
  - Added C++ Compiler and C++ Linker to the toolchain. (Feature Request 1861864)

* AVR Paths preference page
  - New preference page to manage the paths to the avr-gcc toolchain.

* Project Update Converter. 
  - Selectable via "Convert to..." in the project context menu.
  - Updates the project to most changes for version 2.1

* Added an AVR Project Nature.
  - Applied to all projects created with the new project wizard, and old projects 
    updated with the project converter. 
  - Restricts AVR GUI Elements to AVR Projects. 

Changed / Improved:
=============================
* Target Hardware settings are now project settings. They apply to all Configurations
  (Feature Requests 1861874 / 1751707)

* Compiler Tool
  - included the same options as mfile (avr-gcc makefile generator)
  	+ Added "-fpack-struct" and "-fshort-enums" options to the optimization flags.
    + Added "-funsigned-char" and "-funsigned-bitfields" to the language flags
  - removed -ggdb option because I don't really know what it does (mail me if you actually need this)
  - -c (compile only) option now build in and not required under "other options".
    This was actually changed for 2.0.1, but I forgot to document it.

* Additional Tools
  - Handling of additional Tools now done via <enablement> instead of manipulating 
    ManagedBuildSystem internals. (=> Order of Add. Tools is now fixed and cannot
    be changed)

Fixes:
=============================
* All Tools
  - Changed toolnames from "winAVR ..." to "AVR ..." (Bug 1861870)
  
* Assembler Tool
  - Added Dependency Calculator to the input. Dependencies on .h header files are now handled.
  - Changed Debug format option to default "stabs" (the only format avr-gas can produce)
  
* Compiler Tool
  - Changed to a working Dependency Calculator. Dependencies are now correctly handled
    during the build process.
  - Changed Debug format to default "stabs". "stabs" and "dwarf-2" have new descriptive texts.
    Thanks to Jörg Wünsch for explaining the debug format options
  - "UL" appended to the F_CPU value passed to the compiler
  - Missing Compiler Options are fixed by the project update converter (Bug 1861293)
    
* Linker Tool
  - Changed default map filename to ${BuildArtifactFileBaseName}.map (Bug 1867615)

* AVR Device Explorer
  - Now displays an error message box on errors reading the <avr/io.h> file (Bug 1860840)


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 2.0.1.20071229 [29 December 2007]

The main point of this release is to fix the avr-size bug that made it impossible 
to use the Size tool on non-winAVR toolchains (Linux / MacOSX). Some other fixes
minor features are included as well.

Features:
* Assembler Tool
   - Added options to use preprocessor and for debug information
 * Compiler Tool
   - Added option to omit the F_CPU definition from the commandline
   - Added options for debug level and debug information format
   - Added option to select the language standard (Bug 1783023)
 * Size Tool
   - Added option to display size in hex

Fixes:
* Assembler Tool
   - Changed command from avr-as to avr-gcc to enable the preprocessor for assembler sources
   - Extended the org.eclipse.cdt.core.asmSource contentType to include (uppercase) .S files
* Size Tool
   - fixed the bug that -mcu was always passed on to commandline, regardless of format
   - Only the size formats applicable to the platform are shown
* Other
   - fixed wrong paths on non-Windows platforms, now looks in /usr/bin and /usr/local/bin.
     The whole path managment will be rewritten in 2.1
 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 2.0.0.v20071227 [27 December 2007]

This is the first offical release of the completely rewritten AVR Eclipse Plugin. 
The major changes to the last released version 20070813 are:

Features:
 * MCU Type and Clock Frequency set only once per configuration (request 1751707)
 * Debug and Release build Configurations
 * Application and Static Library build types (static lib not tested yet)
 * Builds hex, eep and lss files (user selectable)
 * Assembler integrated into toolchain. (request 1755284 / 1787770)
 * A new viewer to show some information about AVR processors (based on patch 1701653)
 * Basic documentation incl. a small tutorial on how to create a AVR application project
 
Fixes:
 * Works with CDT 4.0 / Eclipse 3.3 (CDT 3.0 / Eclipse 3.2 not supported anymore)
 * Optimize for size included in compiler options (bug 1772860)
 * Windows: Finds paths to the winAVR executables if they are not on the path.
 * LIBS and USER_OBJS included in the linking process.
