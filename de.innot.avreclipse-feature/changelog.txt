Version 2.0.1.20071229 [29 December 2007]

The main point of this release is to fix the avr-size bug that made it impossible 
to use the Size tool on non-winAVR toolchains (Linux / MacOSX). Some other fixes
minor features are included as well.

Features:
* Assembler Tool
   - Added options to use preprocessor and for debug information
 * Compiler Tool
   - Added option to omit the F_CPU definition from the commandline
   - Added options for debug level and debug information format
   - Added option to select the language standard (Bug 1783023)
 * Size Tool
   - Added option to display size in hex

Fixes:
* Assembler Tool
   - Changed command from avr-as to avr-gcc to enable the preprocessor for assembler sources
   - Extended the org.eclipse.cdt.core.asmSource contentType to include (uppercase) .S files
* Size Tool
   - fixed the bug that -mcu was always passed on to commandline, regardless of format
   - Only the size formats applicatable to the platform are shown
* Other
   - fixed wrong paths on non-Windows platforms, now looks in /usr/bin and /usr/local/bin.
     The whole path managment will be rewritten in 2.1

 * A new viewer to show some information about AVR processors (based on patch 1701653)
 
 * Basic documentation incl. a small tutorial on how to create a AVR application project
 
 
 
Fixes:
 * Works with CDT 4.0 / Eclipse 3.3 (CDT 3.0 / Eclipse 3.2 not supported anymore)
